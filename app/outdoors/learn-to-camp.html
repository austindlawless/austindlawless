<h2>Where to camp</h2>

<h4>In Texas</h4>
<h5>County Parks</h5>
<p>Pace Bend Park near Highland Lakes Camp where we have Freshman / Sophomore retreat is a great example.</p>
<h5>State Parks</h5>
<p>In the Austin area, we have Enchanted Rock, Lost Maples, Pedernales Falls, and Colorado Bend.</p>
<h5>National Parks</h5>
<p>Big Bend and Guadalupe Mountain are your choices in Texas. But, Arkansas, New Mexico, and Colorado are close and have some excellent options as well.</p>

<h4>In Other States</h4>
<h5>Public Land</h5>
<p>The Western states, like Colorado and Oregon, have lots of it.</p>


<h2>How to set up a tent</h2>
<h4>Set up your tent at home if it is new to you.</h4>
<h4>Find flat ground with limited vegetation and rocks. Clear debris if needed.</h4>
<h4>Use a ground tarp or footprint to protect the tent bottom.</h4>
<h4>Be gentle with tent poles. Don't break them. Don't tear the tent with them.</h4>
<h4>Match the fly door with the tent body door.</h4>
<h4>Stake out the tent if wind is a concern or if needed for structure.</h4>


<h2>How to use a camp stove</h2>
<h4>It just like a gas stove in a house except you light it with a match. Let's practice!</h4>


<h2>How to build a campfire</h2>
<h4>Be safe.</h4>
<p>Have water or dirt on hand to put out the fire if needed. Use a safe fire ring. Never leave the fire unattended.</p>
<h4>Gather firewood.</h4>
<p>You'll need three types of wood: tinder, kindling, and fuel. Tinder is pine needles, paper, a fire-starter, shaved tree bark. It gets you from spark or match to fire. Kindling is small to medium sticks. There is not sharp distinction between kindling and fuel. Fuel is big sticks and logs. They burn long but require a hot fire to use.</p>
<h4>Pile up your tinder in the middle of the fire ring.</h4>
<h4>Build a tepee of kindling around the tinder, but leave a way to get fire to the tinder.</h4>
<h4>Light the tinder and keep adding bigger and bigger kindling until your fire is ready for fuel.</h4>
<h4>Use the log cabin technique to add fuel to the fire without smothering it.</h4>


<h2>Useful knots</h2>
<h4><a href="http://www.animatedknots.com/reef/">Square Knot</a></h4>
<p>Useful for joining to the ends of two similar cords. This knot is not to be used for life critical loads.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.animatedknots.com/bowline/">Bowline</a></h4>
<p>This knot is used for creating a loop that will not slip or bind. It is a functional rescue knot that can be tied with one hand. But when not under load, the knot can be shaken loose.</p>
<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_half-hitches">2 half hitches</a> / <a href="https://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/tautline-hitch">tautline hitch</a></h4>
<p>These knots are hitches, meaning they secure a line to an object. The 2-half-hitches is about the simplest hitch you can learn, and is multi-functional. The tautline is very similar, and is particularly useful in hitching with a resulting line that is taut - like a guy-wire.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.animatedknots.com/doublefishermans/">Double Fisherman's Bend</a></h4>
<p>This is an excellent knot for attaching two ends of cord. It will not slip, but can bind under heavy load and be very difficult to untie.</p>
<h4><a href="">Clove Hitch</a></h4>
<p>A clove hitch is good for hitching when the knot must be tied under load - such as a bear bag. It is best when tied around rough surfaces; it can slip on a smooth surface.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.animatedknots.com/fig8join/">Figure 8 Bend</a></h4>
<p>This is a secure knot for connecting to cords that is easy ot untie. But, it is a bulky knot.</p>
