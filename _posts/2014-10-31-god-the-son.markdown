## God the Son - Jesus

### Who is Jesus?
He is God. John 8:58
He is the Father's only Son. John 3:16
He is the image of Invisible God. Colossians 1:15

### Where is Jesus?
He is in heaven at right hand of the Father. Mark 16:19, 1 Peter 3:22

### What is Jesus?
He is both God and man.

#### How is Jesus both God and man - incarnate?

"Remaining what he was, he became what he was not."

He has a human body. Hebrews 2:14

He has a human soul. Matthew 26:38, Hebrews 2:17-18, Galatians 4:4

He is conceived of the Holy Spirit and the virgin Mary. Why is this important? Because sin entered all of mankind through Adam, we are born already sinners. Therefore, an immaculate conception - clean conception - was the only way for Jesus to come to earth as man without becoming sinful. Luke 1:31-35

He stayed Holy like God the Father by remaining without sin. Hebrews 7:26


### What does Jesus do?
#### Prophet
He is the Word in the flesh. Christ completed the need for prophets by revealing to us - through his word - the will of God for our salvation. John 1:14, Deuteronomy 18:15-20, Acts 3:22, John 1:18, 1 Peter 1:11, Colossians 2:3
#### Priest
He is the mediator between God and Man. Christ completed the need for priests by offering up a perfect sacrifice to satisfy divine justice. He reconcile us to God. And, He is making continual intercession for us. 1 Timothy 2:5, 1 Samuel 2:35, Hebrews 8:1, Hebrews 2:17, Hebrews 7:25
#### King
He is the Redeemer and Conqueror. Christ completed the need for a king in ruling and defending us and in conquering our enemies. Colossians 1:13, 2 Samuel 7:12-16, Matthew 1:1, Luke 1:33, John 18:36-37

### Discussion Questions
#### Why is it important Jesus be both God and man?
We need savior who is able to reach us and to reach God. This, Christ alone can do. He can do this because He is God and man, in two distinct natures, yet one person forever.
#### Why is the incarnation of Christ an act of love?
Humiliation - born into the lowly condition of a man from the majesty of God. He had to submit to the law. He suffered miseries. He experienced the wrath of the Father. He accepted the curse of death. He remained under the power of death, for a time. Luke 2:7, Galatians 4:4, Isaiah 53:3, Mathew 27:46, Philippians 2:8, 1 Corinthians 15:4
#### What do we learn about Jesus in the Old Testament?
The entire Bible is about Jesus. It should change the way we read the Old Testament. We should always be looking at the offices of Prophet, Priest, King as a representation of Jesus to come or a representation of our need for Jesus to come.
#### What are some of Christ's present activities on behalf of his Church?

He is preparing a place for us. John 14:3

He intercedes for us. Hebrews 7:25

He continues to fight our enemies. 1 Corinthians 15:25-26

#### Which office that Jesus holds do you most see Him as?
#### Which office that Jesus holds do you need to accept more? How should this change the way you think or act?
