## Holy Spirit Overview

![trinity diagram](/assets/img/trinity-diagram.png)

Triune and how the Holy Spirit is part of that Trinity exists in 3 statements:

1. One God. Isaiah 44:6 "I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God."
2. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is God. 1 Corinthians 2:10 tells us that the Holy Spirit has the attributes of God. "The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God."
3. Each part of God is distinct from the other. Jesus points out how they are all different from each other in John 14:23 "Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father ￼will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them."

Jesus designates all three Persons of the Trinity in Matthew 28:19. "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."

Before Jesus the Spirit could come and go from people.

The Spirit was everywhere and enveloped everything. - Genesis 1:2

Regeneration, “rebirth” from which we get the concept of￼being “born again” - Deuteronomy 30:6, Ezekiel 11:19-20, Ezekiel 36:26-27

Indwelling, coming upon people or filling them up - Numbers 27:18, 1 Samuel 16:12-13 1 Samuel 10:10, 1 Samuel 16:14 Micah 3: 8-12

Empowerment for service – Exodus 31: 1-11

Intervention (Mary’s conception) - Matthew 1: 18, Luke 1:35

Infusion (baptism) - Matthew 3:16, Mark 1: 9-11

How Holy Spirit walked with Jesus all the way through His death and resurrection (Holy Spirit strengthened, counseled, and walked beside Christ through it all.) - Mark 1:12-13, Luke 4:1, Luke 4:14, Luke 10:21, Matthew 12:28, Acts 10:38, Matthew 27:50


### The Holy Spirit After Jesus Ascended from Earth

The New Testament teaches the permanent indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers. When we place our faith in Christ for￼salvation, the Holy Spirit comes to live within us. Jesus promised the Holy Spirit as a helper to come along side us. - John 14:26, Acts 1:8

The Holy Spirit intercedes for us in our prayers. - Romans 8:26

The Holy Spirit is responsible for the work of the new creation as He is bringing people into the kingdom of God through￼regeneration (“rebirth”). - 2 Corinthians 5:17


### Discussion Questions:

1. When do we 1st see the HS arrive?
2. What was the role of the HS in the Old Test? How was that important?
3. What is the role of HS in New Test? How is that important?
4. What void would there be if the HS didn't exist.?
5. Have you ever felt the HS/ have you ever experienced the HS?
6. Once Christ returns what role (what need do we have?) does the HS play?
