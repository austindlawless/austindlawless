An attempt at a ad-click website. It's live, though it probably shouldn't be. There are about a dozen issues submitted that should be handled before any ads are put on the site.

## Local set up:
This is a jekyll project. Learn about jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/).

You're going to want to know how to run:
- `jekyll serve`
- `jekyll build` (I think.)

I'm pretty sure your also going to need to run `bower install` to bootstrap and what not.
