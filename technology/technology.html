      <p><p>It is common practice to use CSS classes to format content. With some configuration, the TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor can empower non-code level users to keep with this practice. The styles-dropdown (pictured below) can be populated with a list of classes that can be applied to text in the editor using a span.</p></p>

      <p><p>So, a medium AWS server is about $50 / month. That is a little steep. So, I needed to back up dotCMS and restore it to a micro server. First, I needed a place to put my back up data. I used github for two reasons. I can use git to move files from one server to another when restoring, and I will have version control of my back up data. I created a private repository and cloned it to my dotCMS server.</p></p>

      <p><p>I am starting a website to put the things that I learn on the web. The first will be how to host my own website using&nbsp;<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" title="Amazon Web Services Link" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://dotcms.com/" title="dotCMS" target="_blank">dotCMS</a>. I chose AWS because it offers a lot of flexibility and customization (learning opportunities), and I chose dotCMS because we use it at work and I want to get as familiar with it as possible.</p></p>
