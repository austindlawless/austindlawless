The styles-dropdown (pictured below) can be populated with a list of classes that can be applied to text in the editor using a span.</p>

First, I needed a place to put my back up data. I used github for two reasons. I can use git to move files from one server to another when restoring, and I will have version control of my back up data. I created a private repository and cloned it to my dotCMS server.</p></p>
